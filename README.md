Iâ€™m a <strong>junior frontend developer</strong>, creative web & graphic designer and award-winning photographer as well as a technical psychican by education. At work, I combine technical skills with artistic vision. I made projects for various companies (e-commerce, B2B and B2C) which allows me to be a worthy member of the team which prepares materials, starting from an idea, through implementation, to marketing campaigns.

<strong>I design and implement responsive UI using these technologies and software:</strong>

- JavaScript / TypeScript / Angular / React / Html / Sass / Css / Bem / Gsap / Bootstrap / Wordpress / Git / npm / Webpack 5 / Visual Studio Code / Xampp
- Figma/ Adobe Photoshop/ Adobe Illustrator / Adobe Indesign
